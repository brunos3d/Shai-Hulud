**Quick actions if you find something**
1. Delete any repo named `Shai-Hulud` (or similar) immediately if it contains tokens, env vars or other sensitive data.  
2. Rotate all exposed credentials (NPM_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, cloud keys).  
3. Remove unauthorized GitHub Actions workflows and audit publish activity.  
4. Open an issue or PR on the repo if you need help or want to contribute.

**Privacy note:** Crysknife is privacy-first and runs client-side. We only store hashes/IOCs ‚Äî never plaintext secrets.  
If you're unsure about results, ask for help on the GitHub repo. Stay safe and spread the word. ‚öîÔ∏è
